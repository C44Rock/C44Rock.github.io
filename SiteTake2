        <h1 class = "bioHead">Why software?</h1>    
        <p class = "bio">I've always had a fascination for technology, business, and athletics. I attended The Ohio State University where I studied Economics at the Fisher College of Business while playing football and establishing myself as a leader on our 2015 National Championship team. It was in the Intro to Java course at OSU that I got my first taste of software development.  The regret of not switching majors hasn't left me since. After self-teaching various programming languages while working full-time as a QA Specialist, I knew it was time to fully immerse myself into technology.</p>
            
        <h1 class = "bioHead">What's next?</h1>
        <p class = "bio">Tech Elevator has been a phenomenal start to my journey into software development and I'm excited to see just how high my ceiling is. I'm a natural-born competitor and I'm inspired by continuously setting new goals and the rush of navigating a new path outside of my comfort zone. I plan to leverage my experience in team-building and leadership to enhance a software development team as a junior developer.</p>
